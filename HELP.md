## Recipes

All recipes are available in game, in the "crafting book", 
but are initially hidden. To unlock all of them use this command 
`/recipe give @s *`

## Gates

**Detector**  
Is a falling/rising edge detector, in rising mode it triggers
(like an observer, emitting short signal) when input turns on 
and in the falling mode it triggers when input turns off. 
The mode can be toggled be clicking on the block.

**Switcher**  
When triggered inverts own output (which can also be done by clicking
on the block)

**Inverter**  
Works like vanilla redstone torch but in the form of a redstone gate,
has no delay control (delay is always equal 1 redstone tick)

**Latch**  
Has two outputs, one of which is always active while the other inactive,
this state can be flipped by clicking on the block or by powering the
inactive side.

**Timer**  
When powered will periodically activate emitting a pulse,
the delay between those pulses and their length can be regulated
by clicking on the timer. Available timings: 1, 2, 4, 8 redstone ticks.

**Two Way Repeater**  
Works like vanilla repeater but doesn't have timing control,
(delay is always equal 1 redstone tick) and allows signals to
pass in both directions.
